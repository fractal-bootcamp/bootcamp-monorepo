### How to do the scales?
You can either perform the scales "chromatically" or "sequentially"

In a chromatic scale practice, do the first level of every scale, then proceed to level 2, and so on...
- [js1, data1, react1, express1, prisma1, auth1]

In a sequential scale practice, you focus on just a specific concept, like auth:
- [auth1, auth2, auth3, auth4...]

### Is there anything else I can do?

Yes, honestly [this website](https://www.executeprogram.com/) is a much more curated "scales" experience, and I highly recommend it for practicing subskills.
