# Books
## Fundamentals
- Grokking Simplicity
  - Quick vibes: Functional programming made accessible. Will cure you (allegedly) of object-oriented sensibilities. It's got a fun style with clear examples.

## Rabbit Holes
- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)
  - "Gentle step-by-step guide through the abstract and complex universe of Fragment Shaders"
  - Quick vibes: Shaders seemed arcane and boring until I read the introduction of this book. "Shaders are the equivalent of Gutenberg's press for graphics." Seems powerful.
