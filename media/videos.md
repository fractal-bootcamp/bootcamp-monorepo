## Videos to watch for understanding computer programs:

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> DISCLAIMER: watching videos is no replacement for coding. It can, at its worst, be a way to avoid the difficult feelings of programming -- That being said, they can be a good way to reset and re-orient.

Here are some videos that you can watch to understand software engineering better:

### The Basics (fundamental knowledge, and good review for all levels):
- [Web Dev 101 in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erEgovG9WBs) (13 min)  
- [Javascript in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE) (2 min)  
- [100+ Javascript Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU) (12 min)  
- [Git in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) (2 min)  
- [CS 101 in 13 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis) (13 min)  

### React (how react works):
- [How React Actually Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za2FZ8QCE18) (13 min)

### Computer Architecture (how do computers actually work under the hood?):
- [What's Your Computer Actually Doing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5JC9Ve1sfI), Tom Scott (7 min) - what's your computer doing underneath the hood?

### Philosophy (Why do we program? What is programming good for? What can we aspire to build?)
- [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/906418692), Bret Victor (54 min -- this is a long talk about the sorts of things we can still invent with computers, not about learning programming) 
- [Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F87PtAoJNtg), Rich Hickey (12 min short, or 1 hour in full. I recommend the full talk, but linked to the short one. The long one can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4))
- [The Mess We're In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4), Joe Armstrong (1 hour) -- a talk about the state of software engineering and what we can do to improve it.


### Algorithms
- [Quicksort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE4VP_8Y0BU), Numberphile (3 min) -- short video on quick sort!
