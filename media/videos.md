## Videos to watch for understanding computer programs:

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> BEWARE/DISCLAIMER: watching videos is no replacement for coding. It's an easy way to avoid or escape from the difficult feelings of programming -- unless you're drop dead tired, or busy, I encourage you to find a FUN way to program something with your friends.
>  It can be "dangerous" to code alone (not really, but ykwim), and one of the reasons is because of feelings of incompetence. You're not incompetent! You just need practice and pleasure.
>  It can also be "dangerous" to know too much theory without enough practice, or muscle memory. You might consistently be frustrated by how you can never seem to implement the things you're capable of dreaming up. 
>  If you feel blocked in your coding practice, talk to Andrew about working on a passion project, and he'll help you find a team.

Anyway, that being said, here are some videos that you can watch to understand software engineering better:

### The Basics (fundamental knowledge, and good review for all levels):
- [Web Dev 101 in 13 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erEgovG9WBs) (13 min)  
- [Javascript in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjqpvDnNGE) (2 min)  
- [100+ Javascript Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU) (12 min)  
- [Git in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) (2 min)  
- [CS 101 in 13 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uleG_Vecis) (13 min)  

### Philosophy (Why do we program? What is programming good for? What can we aspire to build?)
- [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/906418692), Bret Victor (54 min -- this is a long talk about the sorts of things we can still invent with computers, not about learning programming) 
- [Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F87PtAoJNtg), Rich Hickey (12 min short, or 1 hour in full. I recommend the full talk, but linked to the short one. The long one can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4))
