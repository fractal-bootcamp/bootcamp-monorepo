## Expectations

# Welcome to Day 1

<v-clicks>

**Right now:** You're an hour into the bootcamp  
**You've heard:** Program overview and Fractal culture  
**Coming up:** This expectations talk, then immediate coding  

<div class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">
📅 Today's goal: Ship 3 PRs before 6pm
</div>

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Orient students to where they are in the day 1 schedule. They've just heard about Fractal's culture and values, now they need the practical expectations before diving into coding. This sets the stage for immediate work while establishing long-term structure.

# Who am I?

<v-clicks>

- Learned basic webdev in elementary school, taught myself to program in middle school
- Built websites for high school clubs, started a computer repair business
- Became disillusioned after learning how the college admissions sausage was made
- Dropped out of college CS program after 2 years
- Realized I wasn't motivated by the default path and needed to make my own
- Founded 2 startups, early hire at 2 others; all failed. RIP 🪦
- Fired from 3 different jobs. RIP 🪦
- Succeeded in others (🤑) turns out not everything is right for you
- Spent >10 years in the industry, from full-stack to platforms, up to Staff level
- Didn't learn how to do things right, but definitely how to do them wrong
- Earning my freedom gave me a new problem; what do I do with it?
- Realized I missed tutoring (math/physics), so now I'm here to teach you what (not 🙃) to do

</v-clicks>

<!--
I'm Eugene. Started coding young and thought I'd follow the normal path through college.

Got disillusioned with college CS - felt like memorizing for tests instead of building real things. Dropped out after 2 years.

Had to figure things out myself. Founded 2 startups, early hire at 2 others - all failed. Got fired from 3 different jobs. But also succeeded in others.

Spent 10+ years in the industry, from full-stack to platforms.

Learned by doing things wrong and figuring it out. That's what we want you to do here - fail fast, learn constantly, build real things.

You're here because you want something different than traditional education. Let's make sure you succeed.

- Catching up is hard - respect everyone's time

This seems strict but there's a reason. Late arrivals disrupt everyone. Missing class puts you behind and requires extra help.

You can earn flexibility in the second half if you consistently exceed requirements. But you have to earn it.

Key: communicate ahead of time if something comes up.

PR requirements build the habit of shipping frequently. In the real world, you want to be someone who ships often and gets things done.

3-5 PRs per day means breaking work into small chunks. Make progress every day, get feedback every day.

Reviews ensure you learn from others' code and contribute to the community.

Meaningful PR = actual improvement, not just moving files around.

Assessments are straightforward if you meet daily requirements.
