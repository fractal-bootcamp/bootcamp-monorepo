# A bit about Paris

<v-clicks>

- 3 years at a startup, 3 years SWE @ Google, 4 years SWE @ Netflix
- Quit my job and joined this bootcamp
- Hobbyist programmer since 12
- "Education Accelerationist"
- Actually did well in High School; perfect test scores, valedictorian, etc.
- Rejected from all the colleges I wanted to go to
- Didn't go to college, searched for a job entirely self-taught instead
- One of the scariest things I've done
- The knowledge and work was easy, the mindset unlock was the hard part!

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
My name is Paris Mitton. I've been a hobbyist programmer since I was 12, but my 10-year 
career has spanned a tiny startup in Denver, working on Google Drive, and working
on the entire accounts ecosystem at Netflix. I've worked on a ton of different stacks,
at a scale from zero users to billions. I quit my job and now I work at this bootcamp.

I'm an education accelerationist: what does that mean? It means I believe deeply in a world
where learning and pedagogy happens unrecognizably different than it does today. The
internet and AI has unlocked learning in a way that absolutely nobody is taking advantage of
properly yet. Fractal AI Accelerator is a key part of that vision.

If I'm so radical about education, you might be surprised to discover I actually do quite well
in traditional education settings. I was a straight A valedictorian in my high school.

But I got rejected from all the prestidgious colleges I applied to. If someone so obviously
suited for traditional learning wasn't getting what I needed, I knew there had to be a better
way. 

Saying no to the traditional path was perhaps the scaariest thing I've ever done, and nearly
everyone in my life told me not to do it. But in truth, it didn't end up being that hard. 
The work and knowledge I gained was the easy part. That was totally intrinsic motivation.
Having the mindset and courage to truly do whatever it took was the extremely difficult part.

Fractal AI Accelerator is built on exactly this principle.

# The Crucible

<v-clicks>

- We have 3 months to rebuild your relationship to tech & work
- It might be the hardest you work in your life
- It should feel difficult and transformative
    - If it's not, hold yourself and your instructors accountable!
- Painful like building muscle, not like breaking bone
- If you're not having fun you're doing it wrong
    - Not all the time, but it should be intrinsically motivating

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
So what is this program, really? I see it as a cruicible. We have 3 months to entirely rebuild
your relationship to work.

It might be the hardest you work in your life. It should feel difficult and transformative.
If it isn't feeling that way, something is wrong, and you should hold yourself and instructors
accountable!

One caveat: it should feel painful like building muscle, not like breaking bone. We want you
to feel like you're being built up, not crumbling down. We want you to have a long, 
successful career in the industry, and you can't do that if you burn out. None of us want 
that.

One key to avoiding burnout is to make sure you're having fun. Something about this
work should feel intrinsically fun. Not all the time, there's going to be a lot of 
straight-up difficult work here. But some pieces should feel fun, and if you can 
identify what piece is fun to you, that will tell you an enormous amount about
the type of work you can do sustainably for years to come. Follow that feeling.

# This is not a traditional school

<v-clicks>

- There are no grades
- "No training wheels"
- Everything is oriented around getting you a job
- Our "edge" is not our curriculum. It's our taste, expertise, and culture
    - Everything we teach you is public!
- You're the one paying! WE serve YOU.
    - You can't "get in trouble"
    - If we aren't helping you the way you need, call it out
- Flip side: Your outcomes are your responsibility

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
This is not a traditional school. There are no grades. There's no certification at the end.
Sometimes school feels like working on training wheels, easing students into increasingly
"real-world" work. We don't have the time to do that. We want to be teaching you exactly
the skills you need to succeed in the tech industry, which means getting as close to 
full speed as soon as possible. Our guiding principle for everything we ask you to do here
is, "is this going to directly help our students get a job?" If you ever feel like it's not,
tell us.

Our "edge" is not our curriculum. It's our taste, expertise, and the culture we've created.
There's an old saying that "information wants to be free." Everything we are going to 
teach you is perfectly public information! But the culture we're creating here is something
that you're not going to be able to teach yourself with a few hours in Google or talking to
Claude. That's our secret sauce, and that's why talking about culture on day 1 is so important.

You're paying to be here! We are providing a service to you! We are not your parents or
disciplinarians. You paid us to help transform the way you work and get you a job in the tech
industry. If you don't like the way your hair stylist is cutting your hair, you ask for 
something else. Likewise, if you don't think the way we are working with you is helping,
call it out so we can figure out how to serve you better.

The flip side to all of this freedom and autonomy is that your outcomes are your responsibility.
We will do everything we can through this program to equip you for success, but the enormous
amount of work and dedication this will take is on you. You will get out what you put in.

# Radical Honesty

<v-clicks>

- "I don't know" is an opportunity, not a weakness
- You're all learning! Nobody knows!
- Vulnerability helps others see how they can help you
- Ego is a major limiter to growth
- Kill the imposter syndrome early & often
- Your instructors should be demonstrating this!
    - We are students, just like you

</v-clicks>

<!--
Let's talk about how important honesty is. Given how much we have to learn and do in the next
few months, we need to be super up front and clear with each other about what we know and
where we are struggling. Everyone here is going to be overwhelmed at times during this 
program. That's normal, and the more you talk about it with your peers, the better they 
can help you.

Ego, fear of looking dumb, and imposter syndrome are all forms of blockages where we don't
give ourselves permission to do something that we need to do. If we are all being honest with
each other about how we feel and what we know, and we voice that publically, we are all
giving each other permission to do remove those blockages.

Hold us accountable to this too! All of your instructors should be up front when they don't
know something or we aren't sure. We are not all powerful tech gods. We are students, just
like you, just much further along the path.

# Community as a Resource

<v-clicks>

- You are now embedded in the Fractal community. Use it!
- These are a lot of people just like you: ambitious, hard-working, open-minded
- Nothing great is ever accomplished alone
- Social investments are like money investments: they pay off over time
- A good network is critical to finding a job
- Say hi to people, participate in events, host your own!
- This is literally how I got here

</v-clicks>

<!-- 

One of the foundational principles of Fractal, not just the bootcamp but the whole project,
is that community is essential to human thriving. 

As a result, you are now embedded in a 
fantastic group of people who are ambitious, hard working, and open minded. Take advantage
of this! Rarely is anything great accomplished alone. 

If you start building a community now, it will take time to finally flourish, and often in
oblique ways you wouldn't expect. A friend of a friend here, an ex boss of an ex girlfriend there,
these connections seem random but over time they really matter.

Also, just for selfish reasons, having a good network will make finding a job 10 times easier
for you.

So say hi to random people, participate in events that you get invited to, and even better yet,
host your own. That will both connect you to people and show others that you're adding value
and are great to have around.

I know this by personal experience! I got my first job, and this job right now, by investing
heavily in personal connections and community. It actually has probably done more for my
well-being than my cracked coding skills has.

# Hacker Ethos

<v-clicks> 

- Openness, working out loud
- Decentralization and lack of authority
- First-principles thinking
- Everything is editable
    - Our curriculum, like our code, is on GitHub! Make a PR!

</v-clicks>

<!--
Fractal is a big believer in the hacker ethos. This is the culture that has produced
much of the internet that we use every day.

We do what we do out in the open, for everyone to see. This has three benefits: it holds us 
accountable to good work, it increases our reach and influence, and it attracts like-minded
people who want to help out. 

We believe in low-hierarchy institutions, and decentralization as a way to keep the world
accessible to everyone. Authorities exist, but only because they've justified it with
their hard work and knowledge.

Think through things from first principles. This is the hallmark of a good engineer, 
but also a form of decentralization. No knowledge is exclusive to the priest class.
Anything we know, you can also learn.

In hacker culture, everything you use is editable. Your code, your culture, even this
class itself! Our class resources are available on GitHub, just like our code will be,
and you are free to submit changes to it if you'd like.

# Summary

<v-clicks>

- This should feel hard. You should be changing week over week
- But this is a marathon, not a sprint. Make sure it's sustainable and "fun"
- Give yourself permission to do whatever it takes
    - There will be emotional, logistical, personal blockages
- Work in public, in community, with radical honesty and ambition
- You're in control of your own outcomes
    - If something isn't working for you, let's figure it out together

</v-clicks>


<!-- 
So, to summarize the culture you're agreeing to abide by here:

You should feel at the edge of your ability, and that you're changing as a person week
over week. It should be pretty hard, but it should feel sore like you're building muscle,
not like you're breaking a bone. There should be something at least a little fun about it.

Give yourself permission to do whatever it takes to find success. Shame, guilt, societal
rules, dishonesty, laziness - these will all get in the way of doing your best work here.

One way to make sure you're doing enough is to work in public, with a lot of honesty
and vulnerability. Surround yourself with people who have your values and care about your
work, and you'll be shocked how far you can go.

In short, you're going to get what you put in to this program. We are not your boss,
we are your servants and guides. We want you to get the most out of this program,
we are going to hold you accountable, and if something isn't working, let's
figure it out together.
