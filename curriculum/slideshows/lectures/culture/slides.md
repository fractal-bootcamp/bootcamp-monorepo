# The Power of Culture

<v-clicks>

- Fractal isn't just a bootcamp, it's a bet on the future of education
- Education in 10 years is going to be completely different
- Let's build what it looks like, right here
- The world is changing fast. Knowledge is commoditizing & changing every day
- We need a culture that can keep up with constant change. This is our "secret sauce"
</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Fractal isn’t just a bootcamp. It’s a bet that the way people learn is about to change.

We’re building something that wouldn’t have made sense 15 years ago. But now, with AI and the internet, 
the default model of education is starting to look outdated.

If the world is changing this fast, we need a culture that helps people keep up—and ideally, lead.

This slide deck is an attempt to name the principles behind that culture. This is our
secret sauce.

# A bit about Paris

<v-clicks>

- Programming since 12, 3 years at a startup, 3 years SWE @ Google, 4 years SWE @ Netflix
- Quit my job and came to teach all of you
- Valedictorian of my high school, but...
- Rejected from all the colleges I wanted to go to
- Didn't go to college, one of the scariest things I've done
- The knowledge and work was easy, the mindset unlock was the hard part!

</v-clicks>

<!--
First, a bit about me. I’ve been programming since I was 12. 

Professionally, I’ve worked at a startup, then at Google, then Netflix. I've worked on a ton of different stacks, at a scale from zero users to billions. 

I quit my job and now I'm here to teach all of you.

I did well in high school. I got perfect test scores, valedictorian. 

But I got rejected from every top college I applied to. 

That forced a choice: take the normal path anyway, or try something different. I chose different. I taught myself, found a job without a degree, and built a career from scratch.

Saying no to the traditional path was perhaps the scariest thing I've ever done, and nearly
everyone in my life told me not to do it. 

But it didn't end up being that hard. 
The work and knowledge I gained was the easy part. That was totally intrinsic motivation.
Having the mindset and courage to truly do whatever it took was the extremely difficult part.
Fractal AI Accelerator is built on exactly this principle.

# The Crucible

<v-clicks>

- We have 3 months to reset how you work
- It might be the hardest you work in your life
- It should feel difficult and transformative
    - If it's not, hold yourself and your instructors accountable!
- Painful like building muscle, not like breaking bone
- This should feel fun!
    - Not all the time, but it should be intrinsically motivating

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
This program is a crucible. We have 3 months to totally reset how you think about work.

It will probably be the hardest you’ve worked. That’s intentional. Growth requires pressure.

It should feel difficult and transformative. If it isn't feeling that way, something is wrong, 
and you should hold yourself and instructors accountable.

One caveat: it should feel painful like building muscle, not like breaking bone. We want you 
to have a long, successful career in the industry, and you can't do that if you burn out. 
None of us want that.

The people who do best here are the ones who treat the process like a game they love playing. 
It doesn’t have to be fun all the time, but there should be moments of joy and flow. If there aren’t, 
reach out, and we’ll help you find them.

# This is not a traditional school

<v-clicks>

- There are no grades, "training wheels", credentials, elitism... just good work.
- Good education is as close to real-world problems as possible
- Our main principle: "will this help students get a job?"
- Our "edge" is not our curriculum. It's our taste, expertise, and culture
    - Everything we teach you is public!
- You're the one paying! WE serve YOU.
    - If we aren't helping you the way you need, call it out
- Flip side: Your outcomes are your responsibility

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
There are no grades. No rubrics. We don't believe in credentials or elitism, just good work

Good education looks as close to real world work as possible. 

Our guiding principle for the curriculum is "will this help students get a job?" If you don't think
it will, let us know so we can talk about it!

Our "edge" is not our curriculum. Everything we teach is public. But we’ve built a system to help 
you learn it faster, with more feedback, and in better company. That's our secret sauce, and 
that's why talking about culture on day 1 is so important.

We’re not gatekeepers. You’re paying to be here, which means we serve you. If you don't like the
way your hair stylist is cutting your hair, you ask for something else. Likewise, if you don't 
think the way we are working with you is helping, call it out so we can figure out how to serve 
you better.

The flip side to all of this freedom and autonomy is that your outcomes are your responsibility.
We will do everything we can to equip you for success, but the enormous
amount of work and dedication this will take is on you. You will get out what you put in.

# Radical Honesty

<v-clicks>

- "I don't know" is an opportunity, not a weakness
    - You're all learning! Nobody knows!
- Ego is a major limiter to growth
    - Keeps you from getting the help you need
    - Keeps you from giving yourself permission to do things
- When we say we will do something, we do it
    - And if we don't do it, we say _that_, ASAP
- Your instructors should be demonstrating this!
    - We are students, just like you

</v-clicks>

<!--
Radical honesty is critical to success here. If you don’t know something, say it. That’s how you 
make progress. Hiding it just slows you down. It's normal to be overwhelmed at times during this 
program. Nobody knows! Talk about that with your peers, so they can help you.

Ego is the enemy. It keeps you from asking questions, from trying things you're not sure you can do, from 
letting people help you.

Radical honesty means living up to our commitments no matter what. But we all are going to fail at this.
When we inevitably can't live up to our commitments, we communicate that too, as clearly and vulnerably
as possible.

Hold your instructors accountable to this too! All of your instructors should be up front when 
they don't know something or we aren't sure. We are not all powerful tech gods. We are students, 
just like you, just much further along the path.

# Community as a Resource

<v-clicks>

- Fractal believes community is essential to human thriving
- You are now embedded in the ambitious, hard-working, open minded Fractal community. 
    - Use it!
- A good network is critical to finding a job
    - Good networks take time to build
- Say hi to people, participate in events, host your own!
- This is literally how I got here
    - Networks > Cracked coding (but have both)

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
One of the foundational principles of Fractal, not just the bootcamp but the whole project,
is that community is essential to human thriving. 

You’re now surrounded by people who are smart, ambitious, and trying to improve. That’s rare. Use it.

The tech industry runs on networks. Jobs, ideas, collaborators—all of it flows through relationships.
You can’t build those overnight, so start now.

So say hi to random people, participate in events that you get invited to, and even better yet,
host your own. That will both connect you to people and show others that you're adding value
and are great to have around.

I know this by personal experience! I got my first job, and this job right now, by investing
heavily in personal connections and community. It actually has probably done more for my
well-being than my cracked coding skills has.

# Hacker Ethos

<v-clicks> 

- They look cool
- Hackers built most of the internet (and Fractal)
    - They don't ask for permission
- Work out in the open
    - Great for accountability, reach, and attracting cool people
- Low hierarchy
    - minimal, justified authority
    - first principles thinking, no secret knowledge
- Everything is editable
    - Our curriculum, like our code, is on GitHub! Make a PR for these slides!

</v-clicks>

<!--
Fractal is a big believer in the hacker ethos. Mostly just because they look cool.

No, I'm joking. Most of the software we use today was built by
people who didn’t wait for permission. That’s the mindset we want you to practice.

We do what we do out in the open, for everyone to see. This has three benefits: it holds us 
accountable to good work, it increases our reach and influence, and it attracts like-minded
people who want to help out. 

We believe in low-hierarchy institutions. Authorities exist, but only because they've 
justified it with their hard work and knowledge. We think from first principles and 
don't believe in gatekeeping knowledge. 

We also don't believe in gatekeeping systems or goals. To hackers, everything is editable.
If you don’t like how something works, you have the tools to improve it. That’s the real 
lesson. We publish our curriculum the same  way we write  our code: in the open, on GitHub. 
You can see it, fork it, suggest changes to it.

# Summary

<v-clicks>

- We are agreeing to:
- Working hard as hell
- Running a marathon, not a sprint. Make sure it's sustainable and "fun"
- Giving yourself permission to do whatever it takes
    - There will be emotional, logistical, personal blockages
- Working in public, in community, with radical honesty and ambition
- Holding your instructors accountable, and getting their help
- Being in control of your own outcomes
    - It's your responsibility to tell us what's not working 
    - Then, let's figure it out together

</v-clicks>

<!--
So, to summarize the culture we agree to abide by here:

Working hard as hell. This program should stretch you. You should be changing week over week.
If you’re not, something’s missing. 

But this isn’t about burnout. It's a marathon, not a sprint. You need a pace that’s 
intense but sustainable.

There will be blocks: emotional, logistical, internal. Don’t ignore them. Treat solving 
those as part of the work.

The best way to stay on track is to work in public. Share what you’re doing. Be honest 
when you’re stuck. Help others when you can.

Make sure that your instructors are demonstrating all these qualities, and if we aren't,
call us out!

In the end, this is your program. You get out what you put in. If it’s not working, 
let’s fix it together.
