# Intro Week

## Description

Kicking off the class, we’ll start by spinning up a personal site, going over CRUD best practices, and making your first portfolio project!

By the end of the first week, most students should be able to pass the “Calculator Exam”, a hiring test Jake gave to all junior candidates at Tenet.
