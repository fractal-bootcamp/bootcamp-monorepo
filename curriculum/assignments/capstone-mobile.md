# React Native AI App with Device Integration

## Overview

For the AI app capstone, your team will work together to build a React Native mobile application that integrates AI functionality with a built-in phone feature such as the camera, microphone, or GPS. Choose a specific use case that demonstrates meaningful interaction between AI and the selected device capability (e.g., object detection with the camera, voice transcription with the microphone, or location-based recommendations using GPS). The app should deliver a polished, functional experience by the end of the capstone.

Youâ€™ll need to scope the project carefully to focus on the core feature set that combines AI with the selected phone capability. Unnecessary features should be removed, but you can expand if time allows. The project should include deployment to a testing platform, such as TestFlight or the Play Store, for showcasing.

## Goals

* **Git on a Team**: Practice collaborative version control.  
* **Scoping / Ticketing / Sprints**: Define and execute tasks efficiently as a team.  
* **Device and AI Integration**: Demonstrate interaction between AI and phone features.  
* **Polished Portfolio Piece**: Deliver a professional, fully functional mobile app.

## Requirements

* **AI Integration**: Use a well-documented AI API (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) for core functionality.  
* **Device Feature Integration**: Leverage a built-in phone capability via Expo modules (e.g., `expo-camera`, `expo-location`, `expo-speech`).  
* **Core Functionality**: Provide an interactive feature that combines the phone capability with AI, such as:  
  * Camera \+ AI for object recognition or document scanning.  
  * Microphone \+ AI for voice transcription or sound classification.  
  * GPS \+ AI for location-based recommendations.  
* **Deployment**: Deploy the app to TestFlight, Play Store, or Expo Go for testing and presentation.

## Suggested Schedule

* **Day 1**: Scoping, split work, initial setup (React Native with Expo, basic device integration, AI API setup).  
* **Day 2**: Deployment (CI/CD), work on the highest-risk pieces (e.g., complex AI or device integration).  
* **Day 3**: Gut check, scope down if necessary, continue work.  
* **Day 4**: Continue work (focus on UI/UX and feature completion).  
* **Day 5**: Wrap up core functionality, polish.  
* **Day 6**: Final polishing, deployment to a testing environment.  
* **Next Monday**: Demos.
