# **Product Clone Capstone**

## Overview

For the product clone capstone, your team will work together to create a replica of an existing product that you like. Pick some of the core features of an existing project, and reimplement them. You can either replicate pixel for pixel (no design challenge) or put a totally unique spin on the product (big design challenge). You’ll likely need to scope down the product to build it within a week, so remove unnecessary features (remember, you can always add more stuff if you finish early).

Goals
