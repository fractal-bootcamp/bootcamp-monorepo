# **Databases**

## Overview

Databases are a fundamental part of most applications. Throughout the course, weâ€™ll be using and abusing databases in every project.

## Core Concepts

- Data Modelling  
- Migrations  
- ORMs

## Features

Set up your database and do the following

- [ ] Model a database with the following entities  
      - [ ] Book (ID, Title, Author, ISBN)  
      - [ ] Author (ID, Name, Biography)  
      - [ ] Genre (ID, Name)  
      - [ ] Member (ID, Name, Email, Address)  
- [ ] Relationships between the entities should meet the following requirements  
      - [ ] Books can have many genres  
      - [ ] Members can rent many books at a time  
      - [ ] Authors can author many books  
- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Write a SQL Query to add a Book  
- [ ] Write a script that uses the Prisma client to add a Book  
- [ ] Write a script that uses the Prisma client to borrow a Book

Bonus:

- [ ] Create a second database using docker compose  
- [ ] Create a second prisma schema in the same project and apply it to the second database  
- [ ] Use [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) instead of Prisma

In your project:

- \`npx prisma migrate dev\`  
- ^ but also, read the prisma docs\!  
- You can use bun to run scripts \-- \`bun run my\_db\_script.ts\`  
- ^ but also, read the bun docs\!
