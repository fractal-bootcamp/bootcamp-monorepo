# Algorithms

## Time:
- ~3 full days

## Overview

Create an Algorithm Visualization App that allows users to visualize the execution of various algorithms. The app should include visualizations for several search algorithms, sort algorithms, and at least one advanced algorithm such as path planning. The visualizations should be interactive and help users understand how these algorithms work step-by-step.

## Core Concepts

- Algorithms  
- Data Structures  
- Animations & Styling  
- Full-stack Development

## Features

A NextJS app with a page for each category of algorithm. When selected, each algorithms should include a plain english description of how it works and what its time and space complexity is.

- [ ] NextJS App  
      - [ ] Home Page  
      - [ ] Search Page  
      - [ ] Sort Page  
      - [ ] Path Planning Page  
- [ ] 4 Pages  
      - [ ] Home Page  
            - [ ] Links to Search, Sort, Path Planning Visualizations  
      - [ ] Search Page  
            - [ ] A dropdown with visualizations for
                  - [ ] Linear Search  
                  - [ ] Binary Search  
                  - [ ] Depth-First Search (DFS)  
                  - [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
      - [ ] Sort Page  
            - [ ] A dropdown with visualizations for  
                  - [ ] Bubble Sort  
                  - [ ] Selection Sort  
                  - [ ] Insertion Sort  
                  - [ ] Merge Sort  
                  - [ ] Quick Sort  
      - [ ] Path Planning Page  
            - [ ] Visualizations for Djikstra

Bonus:

- [ ] Animation controls \- add a small box to each page that allows you to control the animation (size of nodes, speed of animation, “debug mode” \- only move forward onClick). Select from a list of data structures, or randomly generate a new one  
- [ ] Time/space complexity analysis

## Technologies to Use

- Boilerplate  
  - Frontend \- npx create-next-app

## Tips

- Use ChatGPT to generate sample data structures, it’s great at generating large amounts of structured data.
