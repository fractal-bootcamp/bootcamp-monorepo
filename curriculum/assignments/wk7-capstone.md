# The Dream App Challenge

This is your shot to build that thing you've been thinking about forever. One week, 100 hours, from nothing to real users. It's time to use everything you've learned plus every AI tool at your disposal to ship something that actually matters.

## What You're Building

You're creating an application you've always wanted to build. Something meaningful to you. Something you'd use yourself. Something that solves a real problem for real people.

Technical requirements:
- Must be a full-stack application
- Must leverage cloud infrastructure 
- Must use AI tools extensively throughout development (V0, Claude SDK, RAG systems, etc.)
- Must be deployed and publicly accessible
- Must be open source with complete GitHub documentation
- Must have at least one active user by Friday who continues using it for its intended purpose

## Building in Public

This project requires you to build in public. Full transparency. No hiding your process or progress.

Requirements:
- **Day 0**: Tweet/post announcing what you're building and why it matters to you
- **Days 1-5**: Daily updates sharing:
  - What you accomplished today
  - What you struggled with
  - What you learned
  - Screenshots/videos of your progress
  - What's happening tomorrow
- **Launch Day**: Share your live product with a call for users
- **Post-Launch**: Document user feedback and iterations publicly

If Twitter/X isn't your platform, you must create a Substack and publish daily updates there. These updates should include:
- Detailed breakdown of your progress
- Code snippets of interesting solutions (with AI attribution when relevant)
- Screenshots/recordings of the evolving UI
- Honest reflections on your challenges
- Questions you're wrestling with

Building in public isn't optional. It creates accountability, attracts early users, documents your journey, and builds your professional identity.

## By End of Week Deliverables

1. **Working Software**: A functioning, deployed application that real users can access and use
2. **GitHub Repository**: Complete, well-documented codebase with an exceptional README
3. **Live Demo**: 15-minute presentation + demo to the class showing what you built and how users are engaging with it
4. **Social Presence**: Public announcement of your project on social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.)
5. **User Evidence**: Proof that at least one person (not yourself or classmates) is actively using your application
6. **Reflection**: A published blog post about building your dream app in a week with AI
7. **Build-in-Public Archive**: Complete collection of your daily updates

## This Project Is Your Identity Now

This isn't just another assignment. This is the beginning of something that defines you professionally. Your name is attached to this. Your social profile shows this. Your portfolio features this. 

When someone asks "what have you built?" this is what you'll talk about.

This is the project that shows you're not just a student who completed some coursework, but a builder who can conceive something valuable and put it in people's hands within a week.

## The Week Will Be Intense

You'll have support when you need it, but the focus is on you building and shipping.

If AI can generate it, don't waste time on it. Use AI for:
- Boilerplate code
- Documentation
- Testing
- UI components
- Database schemas
- API designs

Focus your human creativity on:
- The core problem you're solving
- User experience refinement
- Finding real users
- Acting on user feedback

## Evaluation

Your success is measured by:
1. Does your app exist and work?
2. Is someone actually using it?
3. Did you build something meaningful to you?
4. Did you leverage AI effectively?
5. Did you consistently build in public?
6. Did you document and share your work?

No users = no success. Period.
