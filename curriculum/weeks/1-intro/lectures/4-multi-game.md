## For Eugene:
- your personal opinions for socket.io client in react (andrew recommends instantiating the client outside of React and just using the global reference)
- react router v7 for lobbying and games https://reactrouter.com/start/modes

## Lecture Notes:

- eugene lecture
lobby list, joining lobbies
multi-client games
websockets on express
players are granted socket ids which uniquely identify them
when move is made, publish updates to those socket connections
debugging? logging? observability?
end state: game lobby list with anonymous games, real time via sockets, not deployed
code review
