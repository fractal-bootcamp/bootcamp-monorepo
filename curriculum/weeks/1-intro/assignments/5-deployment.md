# Deployment

## [Repo Link](https://github.com/fractal-bootcamp/assignment-5-deployment)

## Overview

We have a working app, but it's not accessible on the public internet yet.
Let's use [Sevalla](https://sevalla.com/) to deploy our app so others can play it too!
We will use containers, Docker, and `Dockerfile`s to deploy our code.

## Prework
 - (30 min) [Intro to Containers and Docker](https://endjin.com/blog/2022/01/introduction-to-containers-and-docker)

## Requirements

Your app:
 - is deployed on Sevalla and reachable via a public URL
 - has a `Dockerfile` which creates a container that installs and starts the server
 - allows mutiple people across multiple computers to play games with each other
