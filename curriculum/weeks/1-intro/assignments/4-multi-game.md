# Multi-Client Game

## Lecture Code

## Overview

Make your simple game multi-client. You should be able to play on multiple computers/browser which talk to each other. You’ll need to add a way to discover games that have only one person, manage “connection state” on the server, and sync game state between server and multiple clients.

Use websockets for data transmission:

## Core Concepts

- Algorithms  
- Data Structures  
- React & express  
- Full-stack

## Features

Your multi-client game should add additional views to your [simple game](./simple-game.md):

- [ ] 1 New View  
      - [ ] Lobby  
- [ ] 2 Updated View  
      - [ ] Start Page  
      - [ ] Win Modal  
- [ ] Lobby  
      - [ ] Start or find and join games that need players  
- [ ] Start Page
      - [ ] Set only your name if you have “online multiplayer” set  
- [ ] Win Modal  
      - [ ] Allow for “Replay same user” option

Bonus:

- [ ] Styling - Animations for game moves (react-spring, framer, keyframes)
