# Pre-work

# Monday

Your app:
 - Uses t3.gg, Next.js, Vercel AI's `useChat`, and `shadcn` components
 - Lets users chat with an AI
 - Streams responses from the AI
 - has unique chats (e.g. I can open a new chat, get redirected to `/chat/abc-123`, and go back to that URL later and continue the work)
    - (this can happen via local files for now)
 - Has nice styling using `chadcn`

### Instructions

- Run through the first few pages of the [Vercel AI UI Tutorial](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview)
    - Complete through the part about [message persistence](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-message-persistence)
- Learn about [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) UI components and use them in your own app
