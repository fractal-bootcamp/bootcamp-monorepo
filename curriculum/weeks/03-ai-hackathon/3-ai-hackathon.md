# Week 3: AI Hackathon

Over the last 2 weeks, we've built a foundation on top of our "official stack": 
Next.js, Typescript, Drizzle, Postgres, TRPC. Now, let's put it to use.

## Overview

This week is all about building something meaningful while applying everything we've learned. You'll be working on a project of your choice that will serve as a portfolio piece, demonstrating your ability to build interesting and/or useful full-stack applications. What exactly are you building? That's up to you!

For many of you, it will make sense to extend your previous chat app in various interesting ways; in fact, many of you already have!

For others, it may make sense to extend your hackathon project from this weekend.

This project is not to be vibe-coded. No vibe coding, no AI use except purely for learning, just like before.

## Project Requirements

Your project should:

1. **Technical Requirements**
   - Feature or expose heavy use of AI and the Vercel AI SDK at its core (possibly optional, but talk to us).
   - Use our core stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle, Postgres, TRPC)
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Follow best practices for code organization
   - Include proper testing and error handling

2. **Development Process**
   - Use version control effectively
   - Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
   - Include monitoring and error tracking
   - Follow a structured development workflow

3. **Documentation**
   - Clear README with setup instructions
   - Documentation of key technical decisions
   - User documentation if applicable

## Getting Started

1. **Project Selection**
   - Choose a project that FUNDAMENTALLY INTERESTS YOU. Which you LOVE and want to EXIST and SHOW TO PEOPLE.
   - Ensure it's scoped appropriately for ONE WEEK. You will over-scope it. Seriously, you're going to over-scope it. Try to scope it for 2 days of work. If it's done by the end of Tuesday and you can go purely into polish mode, you know you did a good job with scope.
   - Consider how it can showcase your skills

2. **Planning**
   - Create a project roadmap / developer todo list
   - Build a nice "boxes and arrows" diagram of the high-level architecture

3. **Development**
   - Continue to complete any daily assignments & readings if applicable
   - Implement features incrementally; notice what works well and does not work well during project management
   - Test your system thoroughly as you go

## Project Selection

What project you make is up to you! Spend some time early this week coming up with a project that:
 - is easy enough to do in about a week
 - uses all the skills we've learned so far
 - contains things you don't know how to do yet, expanding your skillset

Some examples that students or instructors have suggsted:
 - an AI cooking assistant, who can create recipes from user's ingredients lists, save them to a personal "cook book", and make modifications on the fly
 - an AI that learns about your favorite movies and shows and proactively recommends related ones based in IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes data
 - A WhatsApp or Discord bot powered by AI (probably with a pairing webiste for configuration/management)

If you spent a good amount of time on it and you're still not sure what to build, talk to an instructor who can help you brainstorm.

## Success Metrics

Your project will be considered successful if it:

1. Demonstrates mastery of our core stack
2. Shows attention to code quality and best practices
3. Implements proper tooling and development workflows
4. Serves as a strong portfolio piece (therefore it must be deployed!)
5. Reflects your growth as a product engineer
6. Is cool and interesting and neat and makes people go "ooh" and "aah"
