# Week 3: AI Hackathon

Over the last 2 weeks, we've built a foundation on top of our "official stack": 
Next.js, Typescript, Drizzle, Postgres, TRPC. Now, let's put it to use.

## Overview

This week is all about building something meaningful while applying everything we've learned. You'll be working on a project of your choice that will serve as a portfolio piece, demonstrating your ability to build full-stack applications using modern tools and best practices. What exactly are you building? That's up to you!

## Goals

1. **Portfolio Development**
   - Design and build a project that showcases your skills
   - Create something you're proud to share with potential employers
   - Demonstrate your ability to work with our core stack

2. **Technical Growth**
   - Master our core stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle, Postgres, and TRPC
   - Implement proper authentication using BetterAuth
   - Apply best practices in code organization and architecture

3. **Tooling Proficiency**
   - Gain hands-on experience with essential development tools
   - Learn to implement and use critical development workflows
   - Understand the importance of proper testing, monitoring, and deployment

4. **Product Engineering Mindset**
   - Learn to think like a product engineer
   - Balance technical excellence with user needs
   - Make informed decisions about features and implementation

## Project Requirements

Your project should:

1. **Technical Requirements**
   - Use our core stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle, Postgres, TRPC)
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Follow best practices for code organization
   - Include proper testing and error handling

2. **Development Process**
   - Use version control effectively
   - Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
   - Include monitoring and error tracking
   - Follow a structured development workflow

3. **Documentation**
   - Clear README with setup instructions
   - Documentation of key technical decisions
   - User documentation if applicable

## Getting Started

1. **Project Selection**
   - Choose a project that interests you
   - Ensure it's scoped appropriately for one week
   - Consider how it can showcase your skills

2. **Planning**
   - Create a project roadmap
   - Break down features into manageable tasks
   - Build a nice "boxes and arrows" diagram of the high-level plan
   - Set up your development environment

3. **Development**
   - Follow the daily assignments
   - Implement features incrementally
   - Test thoroughly as you go

## Project Selection

What project you make up to you! Spend some time early this week coming up with a project that:
 - is easy enough to do in about a week
 - uses all the skills we've learned so far
 - contains things you don't know how to do yet, expanding your skillset

Some examples that students or instructors have suggsted:
 - an AI cooking assistant, who can create recipes from user's ingredients lists, save them to a personal "cook book", and make modifications on the fly
 - an AI that learns about your favorite movies and shows and proactively recommends related ones based in IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes data
 - A WhatsApp or Discord bot powered by AI (probably with a pairing webiste for configuration/management)

If you spent a good amount of time on it and you're still not sure what to build, talk to an instructor who can help you brainstorm.

## Success Metrics

Your project will be considered successful if it:

1. Demonstrates mastery of our core stack
2. Shows attention to code quality and best practices
3. Implements proper tooling and development workflows
4. Serves as a strong portfolio piece
5. Reflects your growth as a product engineer
