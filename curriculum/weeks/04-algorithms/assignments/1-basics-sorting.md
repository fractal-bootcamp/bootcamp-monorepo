# Algorithm Basics + Sorting

Today, we will be learning about a classic algorithms problem: sorting. There are many
sorting algorithms, some good, some bad; but how do we measure how good an algorithm is?
For this, we need Big-O analysis, which we will also learn today.

## Instructions

- Learn about Big O analysis, and why we need it
  - For the basics, see [this medium article](https://medium.com/yasser-dev/understanding-big-o-time-complexity-of-algorithm-in-7-mins-for-beginners-adbe5599d64c)
  - Run through [Chapter 6 of Cracking The Coding Inteview](http://repo.darmajaya.ac.id/4188/1/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview_%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions%20%28%20PDFDrive%20%29.pdf) and the example problems
- Learn about various sorting algorithms and how they work. Some resources:
  - [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbbTd-gkajw)
  - [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)
  - [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/courses/lessons/sorting-algorithms)
- Check your knowledge:
  - What is Big O? How do we use it? Could you analyze your own code's Big-O runtime?
  - What are some tradeoffs between the major sorting algorithms?
  - Which sorting algorithm do you like best? Why?
- Create a new Next.js App
- Learn about CSS Animations and React
  - [Introduction](https://www.developerway.com/posts/intro-to-css-animations-for-react-devs)
  - Review more advanced animation libraries like [motion.dev](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation). you don't need to use them, but they may save you some time.
- Pick a sorting algorithm and create a plan for implementing an algorithm visualization page
  - Consider a step-by-step display, how you would make this work via React?
  - Sketch out some rough designs for UI and algorithm display.
  - Rewind or step forward buttons are optional, but make sure your approach _could_ support doing this, regardless of the algorithm
- Get to work on implementing!
- Goal by end of day: ugly but functional display of a sorting algorithm of your choice
