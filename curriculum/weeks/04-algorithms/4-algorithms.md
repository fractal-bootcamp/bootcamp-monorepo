# Week 4: Algorithms & Data Structures

We have spent the last 4 weeks dealing with the highly practical problems of computers
like databases, APIs, syntax, and web development. Let's explore some of the more
conceptual challenges of computer programming: algorithms.

Although we won't be inventing new algorithms, and you will rarely invent one from scratch,
choosing a fast algorithm (or realizing you've accidentally implemented a slow one) is very
important. Additionally, algorithsm and data structures may come in interviews, as companies
like to know you have "theoretical" along with your practical knowledge.

# Overview

Learn about algorithms and demonstrate your knowledge by creating an Algorithm Visualization App 
that allows users to visualize the execution of various algorithms. The app should include 
visualizations for several search algorithms, sort algorithms, and at least one advanced algorithm 
such as path planning. The visualizations should be interactive and help users understand how these 
algorithms work step-by-step.

For inspiration, see [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting) (but we can make ours much more pretty!)

## Features

- NextJS App
- Home Page: Links to Search, Sort, Path Planning Visualizations 
- Each Algorithm page should have a step-by-step display of how the algorithm operates, using CSS animations
- Page for at least 1 search algorithm
    - E.g. Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Djikstra's Algorithm
- Page for at least 1 sort algorithm
    - E.g. Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort...
- Bous: annotations, unique design, forward/backward buttons, Big O analysis
