# React Native + Expo

## Overview

This week, we will build an Expo mobile application. You have two options:
1. Adapt your existing app built in week 3 to work on mobile. This will be less work than starting from scratch. This will free up time to work on adding more phone-native features like GPS, notifications, microphone, gyroscope, etc.
2. Create a new app, likely centered around AI usage. This will involve creating a new app backend as well.

This will also be our first assignment where we will be able to use
Cursor and AI. This should allow us to move at a much faster pace
than previous weeks, at the cost of potentially outstripping our
own abililty to understand our code.

## Rough Plan

- Monday: Experiment with Cursor, React Native/Expo, and brainstorm ideas
- Tuesday: Skeleton of app complete, set up backend with API and auth
- Wednesday: implement UI/backend
- Thursday: add native features (e.g. microphone, phone, notifications)
- Friday: Polish, ship to beta testing programs if desired
- Saturday: Demos!
