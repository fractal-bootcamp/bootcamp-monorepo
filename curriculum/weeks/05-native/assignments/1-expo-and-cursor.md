# Expo and Cursor

Today, we will formally be introducing ourselves to Cursor, learning how
and when to use it, and then building a skeleton of an Expo app.

## Instructions

- Learn about React Native
    - We will be using React Native for our mobile app via a wrapper/framework called Expo. But first, we need to learn how React Native is different from regular React.
    - Read ["The Basics"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started), but no need
    to dig too deep yet.
- Learn about Expo
    - Read [the overview](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/)
    - Check your understanding. Do research and write down brief answers:
        - Whats the difference between React and React Native?
        - Why would we use React Native instead of developing our own phone apps? What are the drawbacks of this approach? ([hints](https://hackernoon.com/react-native-vs-native-app-development-making-the-right-choice))
- Make sure you're familiar with Cursor. You will likely want to pay for Cursor Pro -- it's worth it.
    - If you're not familar with Cursor, see the [intro docs](https://docs.cursor.com/welcome), or watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3289vhOUdKA).
    - After you get the basics, there's really no way to become an expert. Just starting using it and see what works.
    - The golden rule of AI coding: **DO NOT USE AI-GENERATED CODE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.** Pressing "accept changes" and moving on is extremely tempting. Resist the temptation at all times. It is the quickest way to turn your app to slop.
- Get the basic Expo template app working on your phone
    - If you're feeling lost and want a in-depth tour of Expo, follow the first several steps in this [in-depth tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/).
    - If you're looking to quickly get your hands dirty, follow the [quick tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/).
    - You can use Expo Go if you like, but you'll need to create development builds anyway, so I recommend that approach from the start.
    - Use EAS to build and deploy your app. Setting up local app building is a huge pain.
- Install [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) for a Tailwind-like experience with our Expo app.
- Come up with a plan for your app
    - Spend some time brainstorming a set of features and write down a brief implementation plan.
    - Check the scope. We only have a week, and you'll spend the last 2 days polishing.
    - Draw a system diagram. What backend framework will you use? What will the backend API look like?
    - If you want to share code (types, functions, API definitions and clients...) between your backend and your native app, I strongly recommend putting both of them in the same github repo (known as a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/#what-is-a-monorepo)).
    - Briefly check in with an instructor to get your high-level plan approved.
- Start working on implementation!
