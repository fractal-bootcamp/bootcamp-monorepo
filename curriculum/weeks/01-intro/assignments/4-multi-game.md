# Multi-Client Game

## Lecture Code

## Overview

Make your simple game multi-client. You should be able to play on multiple computers/browser which talk to each other. You’ll need to add a way to discover games that have only one person, manage “connection state” on the server, and sync game state between server and multiple clients.

## Core Concepts

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- React & express
- Full-stack

## Features

Your multi-client features should build on top of your [databases](./3-databases.md) work:

- [ ] Routing
  - [ ] Navigate directly to a game
- [ ] Lobby
  - [ ] List joinable games
  - [ ] Start a new game
- [ ] Results
  - [ ] Rematch option
- [ ] Live update
  - [ ] New moves appear w/o refreshing

Bonus:

- [ ] Styling - Animations for game moves (react-spring, framer, keyframes)

## Technologies

- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/routing) for navigation
- websockets ([socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/tutorial/introduction)) for live updating
